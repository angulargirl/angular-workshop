angular-workshop

This is the source code of the app that we built during the week long AngularJS/bootstrap training workshop.

Topics covered: controllers, views, directives, filters, services, responsive design, d3 visual, angular best prectices, bootstrap, bower, gulp, less, app minification and packaging and many more.

The purpose of this training is not to give you every single detail of angular/bootstrap concepts. It is to give you enough understanding of the high level concepts so that you can get started with working on any AngularJS project.
